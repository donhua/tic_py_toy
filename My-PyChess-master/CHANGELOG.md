Basic changelog for My-PyChess.

## What's new in this version 3.0
- THIS IS THE BIGGEST RELEASE OF MY-PYCHESS EVER RELEASED.
- The code now comes with MIT License instead of the GPL-3 which came with v2.2
- The code was revamped, fixing minor bugs and MAJOR PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS.
- Version 2.2 ran at 22 fps, while this upgrade allows it to run at about 200 fps (on my PC) if fps is not constrained.
- Code is now more easy to understand with code comments throughout the code.
- EnPassant was added (finally).
- Undo moves option was added.
- UI for loadGame menu was revamped, UI for preference menu was simplified.
- Screen flip was added (so that both players get to play from their perspective).
- Save/load games with a new way of storing gamedata.
- Online play was added. This features a ONLINE LOBBY and support upto 10 people to play chess(read more in ref/online.txt)
- Singleplayer saw BIG UPGRADES: A Good Menu, ability to play with a decent PYTHON CHESS ENGINE.
- Now, You Can play against STOCKFISH CHESS ENGINE (see stockfishchess.org). My-PyChess will act as an interface to give you this singleplayer mode. Included with this release, a good menu for stockfish and stockfish install/configure menu to help with installing and configuring stockfish with My-PyChess. Remember, stockfish is the best chess engine in the world, even though it's playing strength is limited, it still playes a very hard level of chess. Chess beginners may choose the PYTHON CHESS ENGINE written by me over stockfish.
