"""
This file is a file of My-PyChess application.
It is a backup of an old feature that would help with FEN chess notation.
It is no longer used in the My-PyChess library, so transfered here.

Also, the notation for castle flag has changed, so changes will be required
to make this work with the current version of the game.
